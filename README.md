My Collection
==============

## a quick and dirty prototype of a web app using the Brooklyn Museum of Arts [API](http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/api/)

The idea: Users to keep track of their favorite pieces from the Museum's collection. Using a web interface, the user can search the collection. There would also be a full screen mode so the user can their collection into a neat slide show or screen saver. This app would probably be very similar to [Google's Art Project](http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/project/art-project) but more geared towards the mission of the Museum.
